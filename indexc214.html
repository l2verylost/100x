<br>Accessing our Service:
<br>To access or play our games or create an account with Us, you may need an account with a social network, like Facebook, and, if you are using our mobile Service, an account with the company that provides your mobile applications, like an iTunes account.

<br>Service Changes and Limitations:
<br>The Service is evolving and We may require that you accept updates to the Service as well as to the Terms, Community Rules, and the L2VeryLost Privacy Policy. From time to time we may make you update the game or your software to continue to use Our Services. We may perform these updates remotely including to L2VeryLost software residing on your computer or mobile device, without notifying you.
<br>L2VeryLost reserves the right to stop offering and/or supporting the Service or a particular game or part of the Service at any time either permanently or temporarily, at which point your license to use the Service or any part of it will be automatically terminated or suspended.

<br>Deleting your Account:
<br>You may stop using the Service at any time and may request that We stop making active use of your data at any time by following the instructions in the Privacy Policy. Unless the local law where you are located requires otherwise, We are not required to provide refunds, benefits or other compensation if you request deletion of your Account.
<br>
<br>6. OWNERSHIP; LIMITED LICENSE
<br>Games and Service:
<br>The Service is comprised of works owned by L2VeryLost, and it is protected by copyright, trademark, trade dress, intellectual property and other applicable laws, rules or regulations. L2VeryLost owns, has licensed, or otherwise has rights to use all of the content that appears in the Service. These Terms do not grant you or any other party any right, title or interest in the Service or any content in the Service.
<br>So long as you abide by these Terms and any other rules, including the Community Rules, L2VeryLost grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable limited license subject to the limitations in these Terms, to access and use the Service using a L2VeryLost supported web browser or mobile device solely for your own non-commercial entertainment purposes. You agree not to use the Service for any other purpose.
<br>If you violate these Terms, or any of Our other terms that apply to you, We may take action against you, up to and including permanently suspending your account. In addition, you may be breaking the law, including violations of L2VeryLost’s intellectual property rights. ANY ATTEMPT BY YOU TO DISRUPT OR INTERFERE WITH THE SERVICE INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION UNDERMINING OR MANIPULATING THE LEGITIMATE OPERATION OF ANY L2VeryLost GAME IS A VIOLATION OF L2VeryLost POLICY AND MAY BE A VIOLATION OF CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LAWS.
<br>Your Account and Virtual Items:
<br>Regardless of what anything else says in these Terms, the Community Rules, or any other Feature Terms that apply to features you may choose to use, you do not own the Account that you create on Our Service, including in Our games, and your Account is not your property. This also applies to other stuff, like in-game currency or items, regardless of whether you “earned” those items in a game or “purchased” them. Your account and any related items are owned by L2VeryLost. L2VeryLost gives you a limited license to use your account and the related items while We offer the Services
<br>WE MAY DELETE OR TERMINATE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE INACTIVE (I.E., NOT LOGGED INTO) FOR 180 DAYS.
<br>IF YOU WANT US TO DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT, YOU CAN GO TO THE PRIVACY POLICY PAGE FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO MAKE THAT REQUEST.
<br>You are not allowed to transfer Virtual Items outside of the Service (i.e., in the “real world”), for example by selling, gifting, or trading them. We won’t recognize those transfers as legitimate. You are not allowed to sublicense, trade, sell or attempt to sell in-game Virtual Items for "real" money, or exchange Virtual Items for value of any kind outside of a game. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void, and We may terminate your Account because of it.
<br>User Content:
<br>If you transmit or upload User Content on the Service, you agree that it will be:
<br>1.	accurate;
<br>2.	not confidential;
<br>3.	not in violation of the law;
<br>4.	not in violation of contractual restrictions or other parties’ rights, and that you have permission from any other party whose personal or other information or intellectual property is contained within the User Content;
<br>5.	free of viruses, adware, spyware, worms or other malicious code;
<br>6.	in compliance with the L2VeryLost Community Rules.
<br>Your User Content will be processed by L2VeryLost in accordance with its Privacy Policy.
<br>You own your User Content, but you give L2VeryLost a perpetual and irrevocable (other than as provided below), worldwide, fully paid-up and royalty free, non-exclusive, license to use your User Content and any modified and derivative works thereof in connection with the Service, including in marketing and promotions. To the extent allowed by applicable laws, you waive any moral rights you may have in any User Content (like the right to be identified as the author of the User Content or the right to object to a certain use of that User Content).
<br>L2VeryLost’s license to your User Content ends when you request deletion of your User Content by submitting a request to gmL2VeryLost@gmail.com.
<br>User Content submitted in response to L2VeryLost promotions (which will be subject to the terms of the promotion);
<br>1.	User Content either shared with others which they have not deleted or already used publicly as allowed under these Terms; and
<br>2.	User Content subject to a separate license with L2VeryLost (which will be subject to the terms of such license).
<br>If you request deletion of your User Content we will take reasonable steps to remove your User Content from active use, which may include suppression of your User Content in our systems. However, User Content may persist in our systems, including back-up copies. We may also retain copies of User Content if we are legally required to do so.
<br>When you post your observations and comments on the Service such as in forums, blogs and chat features, We cannot guarantee that other players will not use the ideas and information that you share. If you have an idea or information that you would like to keep confidential and/or don’t want others to use, don’t post it. L2VeryLost IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OTHER PERSON’S USE OR APPROPRIATION OF ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION YOU POST IN ANY FORUMS, BLOGS AND CHAT ROOMS.
<br>7. MONITORING USE OF SERVICE AND USER CONTENT
<br>We have no obligation to monitor User Content and We are not responsible for monitoring the Service for inappropriate or illegal User Content or conduct by other players. That said, We have the right, in our sole discretion, to edit, refuse to post, or remove any User Content.
<br>We may also, at our discretion, choose to monitor and/or record your interaction with the Service or your communications with L2VeryLost or other players (including without limitation chat text and voice communications) when you are using the Service.
<br>We are not responsible for information, materials, products or services provided by other players (for instance, in their profiles). However, if someone is violating these Terms or misusing the Service, please let Us know by contact Us at gmL2VeryLost@gmail.com.
<br>8. YOUR DEALINGS WITH OTHER PLAYERS
<br>You are responsible for your interactions with other players. If you have a problem with another player, We are not required to get involved, but We can if We desire.
<br>9. PAYMENT TERMS
<br>We provide a service in the form of access to games and Virtual Items. In the Service you may use "real world" money to obtain a limited license to use Virtual Items and/or other goods or services.
<br>How it Works:
<br>You get a limited license to Virtual Items by visiting the purchase page in one of our games and providing billing authorization through the platform on which You are playing (e.g., Facebook, Apple iOS, Android).
<br>On L2VeryLost.com, the payment page will let you know what you can use to pay when you make your purchase. We may change what you can use to pay from time to time, at Our sole discretion. Virtual Items purchased in Our games on other platforms such as Facebook, Apple iOS, or Android will be subject to those platforms’ payment terms and conditions. L2VeryLost does not control how you can pay or how any refunds may be issued on those platforms. Please review those platforms’ terms of service for additional information.
<br>For Virtual Items, your order will represent an offer to Us to obtain a limited license for the relevant service(s) or virtual in-game item(s) which will be accepted by Us when We make the Virtual Items available in your account for you to use in our games or debit the account through which you paid, whichever comes first. Your limited license to Virtual Items for use in L2VeryLost games is a service provided by L2VeryLost that starts when We accept your payment or redemption of third party virtual currency.
<br>For orders to obtain a limited license to use Virtual Items, by clicking the button on the purchase window or page you:
<br>1.	agree that We may start to supply your purchased Virtual Items immediately after you have clicked that button; and
<br>2.	if you reside in the European Union, you acknowledge that you will therefore no longer have the right to cancel under the EU's Consumer Rights Directive (as implemented by the law of the country where you are located) once we start to supply the Virtual Item.
<br>You understand that while you may “earn” "buy" or "purchase" Virtual Items in our Services, You do not legally "own" the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Any "virtual currency" balance shown in your Account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your limited license.
<br>ALL SALES ARE FINAL:
<br>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT L2VeryLost IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY, OR WHETHER YOU MADE A PAYMENT THROUGH L2VeryLost.COM OR ANOTHER PLATFORM SUCH AS APPLE, GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, OR ANY OTHER SITES OR PLATFORMS WHERE WE OFFER OUR SERVICES.
<br>PURCHASES OR REDEMPTIONS OF THIRD PARTY VIRTUAL CURRENCY TO ACQUIRE A LICENSE TO USE VIRTUAL ITEMS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.
<br>If you purchase third party currency or choose to make a payment in our Services through a third party (like Facebook, Apple, or Google), you are agreeing to the third party’s payment terms, and L2VeryLost is not a party to the transaction.
<br>Additional Payment Terms:
<br>You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using an Account registered to you. L2VeryLost may revise the pricing for the goods and services it licenses to you through the Service at any time.
<br>Billing Support:
<br>For billing support, send us an email to gmL2VeryLost@gmail.com with the subject “Payment Support” 
<br>10. PROMOTIONS AND OFFERS
<br>From time to time, We may offer limited time promotions.  Please review the official rules (if any) associated with the promotion. They will apply in addition to these Terms.
<br>In addition, from time to time, We may promote Offers.  We are not required to give, and players are not required to accept, any Offer. Offers are not transferable, redeemable or exchangeable for other things of value, except at our sole discretion.  If you accept any Offer, you may have to sign a declaration of eligibility and liability release, or sign other paperwork in order to get the Offer.  Some Offers will be subject to taxes and other charges, travel, or activities outside of the virtual world, all of which will be disclosed before You accept the offer.  If you accept an Offer you also assume all liability associated with the Offer.
<br>11. THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING
<br>Our Service and our games may feature advertisements from Us or other companies.  Our Privacy Policy explains what information We share with advertisers. Please read it.
<br>Sometimes We provide links in Our games or on the Service to other companies websites or to companies who invite you to participate in a promotional offer and offer you some feature of the Service or upgrade (such as in-game currency) in exchange. Any charges or obligations you take on in dealing with these other companies are your responsibility.
<br>We make no representation or promises about any content, goods or services these other companies provide, even if linked to or from Our Service or games. Also, just because We allow a link to be included in Our games or Service does not mean We endorse that linked site. We are not liable for any claim relating to any content, goods and/or services of third parties.
<br>Please also note that the linked sites are not under our control and may collect data or ask you to provide them with your personal or other information, or they may automatically collect information from you. When you use other companies’ services like these, the other company’s service may (or may not) ask you for permission to access your information and content. We are not responsible for these other companies’ content, business practices or privacy policies, or for how they collect, use or share the information they get from you.
<br>12. COPYRIGHT NOTICES/COMPLAINTS
<br>We respect the intellectual property rights of others and ask that you should, too. We reserve the right to terminate any player's access to the Service if We determine that the player is a "repeat infringer." We do not have to notify the player before We do this. We also accommodate and do not interfere with standard technical measures copyright owners use to protect their materials.
<br>13. FEEDBACK AND Unsolicited Ideas
<br>Sometimes, We may request your feedback on certain features through a promotion or our customer insights program. Any feedback you provide at Our request through a promotion or program is subject to the rules of the specific promotion or program.
<br>Any idea, information or feedback you submit to us without Our specific request is subject to Our Unsolicited Ideas Policy.
<br>14. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER; SERVICES AVAILABLE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS
<br>Neither L2VeryLost nor any L2VeryLost Affiliate makes any promise or guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free.
<br>USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. IT IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, L2VeryLost AND ANY L2VeryLost AFFILIATE MAKE NO WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS OR OTHER TERMS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. L2VeryLost AND ANY L2VeryLost AFFILIATE DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS OR OTHER TERMS OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, QUIET ENJOYMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
<br>If your state or country does not allow these disclaimers, they do not apply to you. If your state or country requires a certain period for which a warranty applies, it will be either the shorter of 30 days from your first use of the Service or the shortest period required by law.
<br>15. LIMITATIONS; WAIVERS OF LIABILITY
<br>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT L2VeryLost AND THE L2VeryLost AFFILIATES ARE NOT LIABLE
<br>(1) FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL OR DATA, IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICE; OR
<br>(2) FOR THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER USERS OF THE SERVICE AND OPERATORS OF EXTERNAL SITES.
<br>THE RISK OF USING THE SERVICE AND EXTERNAL SITES RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU AS DOES THE RISK OF INJURY FROM THE SERVICE AND EXTERNAL SITES.
<br>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY ANY LAW THAT APPLIES, THE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY IN THESE TERMS APPLY TO ALL DAMAGES OR INJURY CAUSED BY THE SERVICE, OR RELATED TO USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICE, UNDER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION IN ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTIONS FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE).
<br>Some states or countries do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitations/exclusions of liability described above. So these limitations/exclusions may not apply to you if you reside in one of those states or countries.
<br>16. INDEMNITY
<br>If you use or misuse the Service, or if you violate these Terms or any other applicable rules, including the Community Rules or Feature Terms, and that results in loss or damage or in a claim or liability against L2VeryLost or any L2VeryLost Affiliate, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless L2VeryLost and/or the L2VeryLost Affiliate (which means you agree to compensate L2VeryLost and/or the L2VeryLost Affiliate on a "euro for euro" basis) for that loss, damage, claim or liability, including compensating L2VeryLost and/or the applicable L2VeryLost Affiliate for our legal fees or expenses. If L2VeryLost or the L2VeryLost Affiliate wants to, they are allowed to take exclusive charge of the defense of any case on which you are required to compensate or reimburse them, and it will be at your expense. You also have to cooperate in L2VeryLost’s and/or the L2VeryLost Affiliate’s defense of these cases. L2VeryLost and/or the L2VeryLost Affiliate will use reasonable efforts to let you know if they learn of any claim on which you have to compensate or reimburse them. This will apply even if you stop using the Services or your account is deleted.
<br>17. ASSIGNMENT
<br>We may give our rights, or Our obligations, under these Terms, Feature Terms, Community Rules, or our Privacy Policy to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not give your rights or your obligations under these Terms, Feature Terms, Community Rules, or our Privacy Policy without first getting L2VeryLost’s written consent, and any attempt to do so without our consent is void.
<br>18. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
<br>These Terms, and any other policies or rules We reference in these Terms, make up the entire agreement between you and Us relating to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede all prior understandings of the parties relating to the subject matter of these Terms, whether those prior understandings were electronic, oral or written, or whether established by custom, practice, policy or precedent, between you and Us.
<br>19. LANGUAGE OF THE TERMS
<br>If We provide a translated version of these Terms, Feature Terms, the Community Rules, the L2VeryLost Privacy Policy, or any other terms or policy, it is for informational purposes only. If the translated version means something different than the English version, then the English meaning will be the one that applies.
<br>20. NO WAIVER
<br>If We do not enforce a provision of these Terms, Feature Terms, the Community Rules, or our Privacy Policy, that does not waive our right to do so later. And, if We do expressly waive a provision of these Terms, Feature Terms, the Community Rules, or our Privacy Policy that does not mean it is waived for all time in the future. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by both you and Us to be legally binding.
<br>21. NOTICES
<br>We may notify you by posting something on www.L2VeryLost.com, or in the L2VeryLost game(s) you play, and sending you an e-mail or using other ways of communicating with you based on the contact information you provide to Us.
<br>Any attempted notice that does not follow these rules has no legal effect.
<br>
<br>22. EQUITABLE REMEDIES
<br>You agree that given the unique and irreplaceable nature of the rights granted and obligations made under these Terms and the Community Rules, if you breach these Terms, Feature Terms, Community Rules and/or our Privacy Policy, or intend to breach these Terms, Feature Terms, Community Rules or Privacy Policy, money damages alone will not be enough to repair the harm to L2VeryLost. 
<br>
<br>23. FORCE MAJEURE
<br>We are not liable for any changes or problems out of our control, for example changes or problems caused by like natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, network infrastructure failures, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.
